# CloudDraw
This project was developed for the Cloud Computing course during my bachelor studies.
My main contribution was the creation of the iOS app, through which I practiced using common software patterns.
Benjamin Kramser took care of the Cloud Function.

We recreated Google's 'Quick, Draw!' game and evaluate the drawing in the cloud, as the class demanded using the cloud in some way.
The data set used is the public data set provided by Google.

Later, the game was integrated into a larger project through pods
